  question: 'A reduced pressure principle backflow assembly test will indicate a
    leaking number 2 shut-off valve by:'
  category: BPAT
  answers:
  - No change in the differential pressure reading when testing the differential
    pressure relief valve
  - A drop in differential pressure and relief valve discharge
  - A drop of one (1) psid pressure
  - ' a differential pressure drop to zero (0) psig'
